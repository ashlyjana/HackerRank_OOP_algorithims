The function checks whether two kangaroos, starting at positions x1 and x2 and jumping at speeds v1 and v2, will ever land on the same spot; if the second kangaroo is faster or equally fast (v1 <= v2), the answer is immediately "NO" since the first can never catch up. Still, if the first is faster, the program simulates up to 10,000 jumps by adding each kangarooâ€™s velocity to its position in every loop. If at any point their positions become equal, it returns "YES", otherwise after all jumps it returns "NO".
