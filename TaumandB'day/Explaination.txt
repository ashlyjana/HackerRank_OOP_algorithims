This program helps Taum buy gifts for his friend Bday. Taum needs to buy a certain number of black gifts (b) and white gifts (w). Each black gift costs bc coins, each white gift costs wc coins, and there’s also a conversion cost z if you want to change one color of gift into the other. Instead of always buying gifts directly, the program checks if it’s cheaper to buy one color and convert it into the other. It calculates the lowest possible cost for black gifts and white gifts, then multiplies by the number needed. Finally, it adds them up and gives the minimum total cost Taum has to spend.
