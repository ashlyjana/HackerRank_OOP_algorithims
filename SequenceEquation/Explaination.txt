This programm code solves a problem where you are given a permutation p of the numbers from 1 to n. 
For each number x from 1 to n, the code finds the position of x in the permutation, then finds the position of that position in the permutation again, and returns this final position as the result.
 It uses a dictionary to quickly look up the position of any value in the permutation. The output is a list of these final positions for all numbers from 1 to n.
