
This program finds how many valleys a hiker crosses.
 A valley is when the hiker goes below sea level and comes back up. The program keeps track of the hikerâ€™s steps up (U) and down (D).
 Each time the hiker goes back to sea level after going down, it counts as one valley. 
In the end, it shows the total valleys.
