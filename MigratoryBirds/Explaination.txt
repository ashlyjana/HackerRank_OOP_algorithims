The migratoryBirds program determines which bird type appears most frequently in a given list of bird sightings. 
It first initializes an array counts of size 6 (index 1â€“5 represent bird types) to store the frequency of each bird type.
 As it iterates through the input list arr, it increments the count for each bird type in counts. 
After counting, it loops through bird types 1 to 5, keeping track of the highest frequency found and storing the corresponding bird type in result.
 If two or more bird types have the same frequency, the one with the smaller type number is chosen since the loop checks in increasing order. 
Finally, it returns the result, which is then printed as the most common bird type.
