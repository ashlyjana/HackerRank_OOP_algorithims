This code helps decide if a professor will cancel a class based on student arrival times.
 It reads multiple test cases, and for each one, it checks how many students arrive on time or early arrival time less than or equal to zero.
 If the number of on-time students is less than a given threshold, the professor cancels the class and the program prints YES. 
Otherwise, the class goes on and it prints NO.
