This code calculates the highlighted area when a word is selected in a PDF viewer where each letter has a different height. 
It takes a list of 26 numbers representing the heights of letters 'a' to 'z' and a word as input.
 The program finds the tallest letter in the word by checking each letterâ€™s height from the list, then multiplying that tallest height by the length of the word to get the total area.
 Finally, it prints this area as the result.
