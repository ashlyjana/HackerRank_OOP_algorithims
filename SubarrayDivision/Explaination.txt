The program solves the BirthdayChocolate problem by finding how many ways a list of integers s can be divided into continuous subarrays of length m whose sum equals d. It begins by setting counters for the current position and valid segments, 
Then, it uses a while loop to iterate through the list and a for loop to calculate the sum of each subarray.
 If a subarrayâ€™s sum matches d, it increases the count. Once all possible segments are checked, it returns the total count,
 which represents the number of valid ways the chocolate bar can be divided according to the given conditions.
