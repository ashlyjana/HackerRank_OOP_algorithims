This program is about forming the best team out of a group of people. Each person knows some topics marked as 1 for yes, 0 for no. 
The program checks every possible pair of people, adds up what they know together, and finds which team knows the most topics.
 It then tells us two thing the maximum number of topics any team can cover, and how many different teams can reach that maximum.
