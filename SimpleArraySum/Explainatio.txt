This program reads a list of integers, adds them together, and prints the total sum. First, the user inputs how many numbers there are, then enters the numbers separated by spaces. The program stores these numbers in a list and calls the function simpleArraySum, which starts with a sum of zero and uses a loop to add each number one by one until all numbers are processed. The loop runs as long as the condition i < ar.Count is true, meaning there are still numbers left to add. Once finished, the function returns the total sum, and the program outputs this result.
