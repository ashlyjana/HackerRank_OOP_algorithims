This code solves the problem of distributing sweets to prisoners sitting in a circle. 
Given the number of prisoners n the number of sweets m  and the starting prisoner s the program calculates which prisoner will receive the last sweet. 
It uses modular arithmetic to wrap around the circle correctly and returns the chair number of the prisoner who gets the last sweet.
 The program handles multiple test cases by reading inputs and printing the results for each.
