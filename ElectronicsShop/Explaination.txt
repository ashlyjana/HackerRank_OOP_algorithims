This program helps find the most money a person can spend on buying one keyboard and one USB drive without going over their budget.
 It works by checking every possible pair of keyboard and drive prices.
 For each pair, it adds the prices to get the total cost.
 If the total cost is within the budget and higher than the current maximum found, it updates the maximum.
 If no pair fits the budget, it returns -1.
 Finally, it prints the maximum amount of money that can be spent.
