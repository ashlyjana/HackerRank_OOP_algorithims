Thisprogram code performs a circular rotation on an array and then answers queries about the rotated array.
 Circular rotation means shifting the elements of the array to the right by k positions, wrapping around the end to the beginning.
 Instead of actually rotating the array, the code calculates the original position of each queried index before rotation using modular arithmetic.
 For each query it finds the element in the original array that would appear at the queried position after rotation and returns those elements as the result. 
This approach is efficient because it avoids modifying the array multiple times.
