This program solves the "Cut the Sticks" problem by repeatedly reducing the length of all sticks by the length of the smallest stick until no sticks remain. At each step, it first records how many sticks are still left, then finds the shortest stick, subtracts its length from all sticks, and removes any sticks that become zero or less. This process repeats until the list of sticks is empty, and the recorded counts of sticks after each cut are returned and printed.
