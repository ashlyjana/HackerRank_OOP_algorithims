this libraryFine function calculates a fine based on how late a book is returned compared to its due date.
 If the book is returned on time or early the fine is 0. If it’s late but in the same month and year the fine is 15 units per day late.
 If it’s late by months but in the same year the fine is 500 units per month late.
 If it’s returned in a later year the fine is a fixed 10,000 units. 
The code checks these conditions step-by-step and returns the correct fine.
