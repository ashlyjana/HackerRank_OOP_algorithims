This code counts how many "beautiful days" are between two given days, i and j.
 A day is considered beautiful if the absolute difference between the day number and its reverse is divisible by a given number k.
 The program goes through each day in the range, reverses the digits of the day number, calculates the difference, and checks if it is divisible by k.
 It keeps track of how many days meet this condition and returns that count as the result.
