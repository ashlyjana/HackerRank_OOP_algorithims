This program reads a list of students grade and rounding it before printing the results. Using a if else condition, if a grade is less than 38, its a failing mark.For grades 38 and above, the program calculates the next multiple of 5 and if the difference between this multiple and the grade is less than 3, the grade is rounded up to that multiple, otherwise it stays the same. All updated grades are stored in a new list and then displayed, each on a separate line.
