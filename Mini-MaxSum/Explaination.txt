This code goes through an array of numbers, adding them all together while also checking for the smallest and largest values.
 Once the loop is done, it calculates two results: the minimum sum (by subtracting the largest number from the total sum) and the maximum sum (by subtracting the smallest number from the total sum).
 Finally, it prints both values, which represent the smallest and largest possible sums when you add all numbers except one.
