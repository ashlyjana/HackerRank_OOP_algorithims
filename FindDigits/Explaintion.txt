Calling  function findDigits takes an integer n and counts how many of its digits evenly divide n.
 It extracts each digit by repeatedly taking the remainder when dividing by 10 skips digits that are zero to avoid division by zero and checks if n is divisible by that digit. 
The count of such digits is returned.
