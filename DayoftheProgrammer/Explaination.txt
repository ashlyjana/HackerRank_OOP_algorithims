The dayOfProgrammer program determines the exact date of the 256th day of a given year in Russia, considering the countryâ€™s calendar transition.
 If the year is 1918, Russia switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, so the date is fixed at 26.09.1918.
 If the year is before 1918, the Julian calendar rules apply, where a leap year occurs if the year is divisible by 4; leap years return 12.09.year, while non-leap years return 13.09.year.
 For years after 1918, the Gregorian calendar rules apply, where a leap year occurs if the year is divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 but not by 100; leap years again return 12.09.year, and non-leap years return 13.09.year. The program then prints the resulting date as the output.
